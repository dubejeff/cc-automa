            <p>ONCE THE SR HAS BEEN PLACED, THE PLAYER MAKE A NORMAL TARGETING ROLL [O20.2.3] USING THE RANGE BETWEEN THE SPOTTER AND THE SR’S CURRENT HEX. THIS ROLL IS MODIFIED BY ANY HINDRANCES ALONG THE WAY, AS USUAL [10.3.1].</p>

                <p>SOME WEAPONS ARE ABLE TO PLACE A SMOKE MARKER IN THE TARGETED HEX (AS INDICATED BY THE WORD “SMOKE” TO THE RIGHT OF THE WEAPON’S ILLUSTRATION) INSTEAD OF MAKING A NORMAL FIRE ATTACK ROLL. ORDNANCE IS ALLOWED TO TARGET ANY HEX WITHIN ITS RANGE – EVEN ONE CONTAINING NO ENEMY UNITS – IF IT WILL PLACE SMOKE THIS WAY.

                <p>TWO OR MORE ACTIVATED UNITS/WEAPONS (OR “PIECES”) MAY FIRE TOGETHER BY COMBINING INTO A FIRE GROUP. EVERY PIECE IN A FIRE GROUP MUST HAVE BOTH AN UNOBSTRUCTED LOS TO THE TARGET HEX AND BE WITHIN RANGE OF THAT HEX FOR THE FIRE ATTACK ROLL TO BE MADE. FURTHERMORE, IF UNITS IN A FIRE GROUP OCCUPY MORE THAN ONE HEX, EACH SUCH HEX MUST BE ADJACENT TO AT LEAST ONE OTHER (SO THAT IT FORMS A “CHAIN” OF ADJACENT FIRING UNITS).</p>

                <h3>ATTACK HINDRANCES</h3>
                <p>IF THE LOS FROM ANY NON-ORDNANCE FIRING PIECE AND THE TARGET HEX IS HINDERED [10.3], THAT SHOT’S FP IS REDUCED BY THE LARGEST SUCH HINDRANCE. IF THIS WOULD MODIFY THE ATTACK’S TOTAL FP TO ZERO OR LESS, THE SHOT CANNOT EVEN BE ATTEMPTED, THOUGH THE FIRING PIECE(S) COULD STILL ATTEMPT A DIFFERENT SHOT WITH A LESSER (OR NO) HINDRANCE.</p>

                    <p><b>JAMMED! TRIGGER</b> - IF A FIRE ATTACK ROLL RESULTS IN A JAMMED! TRIGGER, ALL FIRING WEAPONS BREAK. THIS DOES NOT CANCEL THE ATTACK NOR OTHERWISE REDUCE ITS EFFECTIVENESS (OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT JAMMED! TRIGGERS ARE FOUND ON EXTREMELY LOW ROLLS...).</p>
